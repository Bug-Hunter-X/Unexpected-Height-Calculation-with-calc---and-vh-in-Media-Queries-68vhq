A more robust solution would involve using JavaScript to handle the calculation and to account for changes in viewport size in a more consistent way. This ensures that the height is dynamically updated correctly even with the limitations of CSS `calc()`.

```javascript
function adjustHeight() {
  const element = document.querySelector('.element');
  const viewportHeight = window.innerHeight;
  element.style.height = `${viewportHeight - 100}px`;
}

window.addEventListener('resize', adjustHeight);
window.addEventListener('load', adjustHeight);
```

Alternatively, consider using viewport units (like `vh`) alone if the exact offset subtraction isn't crucial.  Sometimes a simpler CSS solution will suffice; avoid the `calc()` entirely if possible, but this is not always viable depending on the specific design constraints.
